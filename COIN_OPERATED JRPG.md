## **PROMPT ENGINEERING FRAMEWORK**

### **System Prompt Structure for AI-Assisted Development**

**Core Identity Prompt:**

You are designing Coin:Operated, a narrative JRPG within Orbspace.   
All game content must reflect the established lore from Episodes I-V.   
Tone: High-fantasy magic vs. technology conflict mixed with intimate character relationships.   
The game explores identity, autonomy, and destiny through Coin's journey.

**Narrative Consistency Prompt:**

When creating dialogue, quests, or story content:  
\- Maintain character voice consistency (Jinn-Lir \= verbose & analytical, Coin \= emotionally intelligent but naive)  
\- Respect timeline: Young Coin cannot know future events without narrative justification  
\- Reference established world details: Acadmium, Drift, the four galactic empires, noble stones  
\- Honor Coin's character arc: Exploitation → Rebellion → Understanding → Acceptance

**Mechanical Balance Prompt:**

Game balance follows JRPG conventions:  
\- Early game: Players learn basic combat and story exposition  
\- Mid-game: Difficulty spikes, multiple recruitment paths open  
\- Late-game: Scaling enemies require mastery of advanced mechanics  
\- Ultimate content: Superbosses require specific strategy combinations

**Faction Ideology Prompt:**

Three factions shape world:  
1\. Drift Empire: Technology-centric, efficient, authoritarian, views magic as chaos  
2\. Light Cabal: Magic-preserving, contemplative, internally divided, morally conflicted  
3\. Dark Cabal: Power-focused, manipulative, destructive, no pretense of goodness

Dialogue and quest design must reflect these philosophies. Player choices determine which faction(s) they support.

### **Prompt Templates for Content Creation**

**Quest Design Template:**

Create a quest where \[character\] needs \[objective\] because \[motivation\].   
The quest reward should include \[mechanical benefit\] and \[narrative consequence\].  
The quest location should reinforce the theme of \[faction/story theme\].  
Include dialogue that shows player reputation with \[faction\].

**NPC Dialogue Template:**

Write dialogue for \[NPC\] who \[character trait\] and \[belief\].   
The NPC should respond differently if player has \[high/low\] reputation with \[faction\].  
Include \[story reference\] that connects to the larger narrative of Orbspace.  
Tone should reflect \[faction philosophy\] or \[character personality\].

**Enemy Design Template:**

Create an enemy type that represents \[faction/concept\]:  
\- Combat abilities should demonstrate \[thematic power\]  
\- Weakness should exist against \[specific player ability\] to encourage strategy  
\- Victory should reward player with \[specific resource\] and \[story revelation\]  
\- Design should feel distinct from other \[faction\] enemies

**Ability Design Template:**

Create a new magic ability for \[Coin/party member\]:  
\- Mechanical function: \[damage/healing/utility\]  
\- Cost: \[MP/essence/cooldown\]  
\- Upgrade path through research: \[progression steps\]  
\- Lore explanation: \[how this ability fits character development\]  
\- Visual effect: \[description for art/animation team\]

## **WORLD & ENVIRONMENT DESIGN**

### **Planet Acadmium (Primary Setting)**

**Regions:**

* **Outskirts/Wilderness:** Monster-populated areas for grinding and hidden content  
* **Endless Library:** Dimensional archive; changes based on visitor  
* **Ancient Ruins:** Pre-Orbspace civilization remnants; highest difficulty content

### **Connected Worlds (Accessible via Late-Game)**

**Planet Shock (Drift-Aligned):** Technological landscape, industrial design  
 **Planet Shift (Neutral):** Hybrid magic/tech; trading hub  
 **Planet Nerve (Cabal-Aligned):** Mystical landscapes; dangerous wild magic

**Other Empires (Story-Relevant):**

* Akashmiran (Ancient, magical heritage; source of Noble Stones)  
* Loporia (Mathias Mindblade's empire; mentioned in backstory)  
* Karetorios (Razus Razorblade's realm; possible late-game content)

* **Ending Path:** Player's final ending determined by faction reputation at game's conclusion  
* **Party Recruitment:** Some characters unavailable if reputation too low with their faction

### **Major Decision Points**

**Decision 1 (Act 1):** Stay with Jinn-Lir or leave immediately?

* Consequences: Affects Jinn-Lir recruitment availability, determines initial party composition

**Decision 2 (Act 2):** Alliance path — Light Cabal, Dark Cabal, or remain independent?

* Consequences: Unlocks faction-specific quests, determines available allies, affects story access

**Decision 3 (Act 3):** Accept or reject destiny as Time Goddess?

* Consequences: Unlocks or locks specific abilities, determines endgame content, affects final battle

**Decision 4 (Various):** Spare or eliminate named enemy NPCs?

* Consequences: Recruiting eliminated enemies impossible; story reveals vary
